### Design:

  The overall design concept was to provide users with a slick, smooth and pleasant to look at experience, with quick clear navigation. A 'Material Design' approach was undertaken in the design, especially for mobile.
  
  **Colors:** 
  I wanted to stay away from the often clinical and formal black/white/minimal visuals of most regular e-commerce websites by providing a softer approach using a purple/blue feel as statistics show these are the worlds favourite colors.
  * Purple/Blue Scheme:
  * rgba(92, 69, 125)
  * rgba(84, 69, 117)
  * rgba(157, 154, 245)
  * #6c757d
  * #aab7c4
  * #17a2b8
  * #6eb9f7
  * #878d9c
      
  To compliment the purple/blue hues I used orange/red tones on various elements such as call to action elements.
    * Orange/Red Scheme:
      * #dc3545
      * #f09162
      
  **Font:**
    The font used is Open Sans from google fonts.
        
  **Layout:** 
     The user should be able to be comfortable with the overall layout for a better experience. Things should be easy to access and options displayed clearly.
      
  * Overall Layout: The use is greeted by a warm colorful landing page, all navigation options are available and a call to action clearly displayed in the center of the screen. As the user enters the shop they can see all products available to view purchase, or if an authenticated user, rate and write reviews. Every page contains call to action elements so the user can make decisions efficiently, from searched products to product to cart to checkout.
      
  **Navigation:**
    The navbar has a dropdown on hover feature for users quick access to desired area.
    For mobile response navigation I have opted to use a sliding nav as I believe it provides better UX than a the traditional dropdown of bootstrap. I used a model to achieve this html and just css for design.
    A minimal animated main search bar that gives the user that material design feel.
    
  **Footer:**
    Footer is transparent as not to impose and features all relevent information and social icon links.
    Some jQuery is used to keep footer displayed at the bottom of page.
        
  **Products:**
    Products are clearly displayed in cards with all relevent information regarding the product.
        
  **Cart:**
    Cart page provides added products with detailed display, options to remove or update items, add a coupon for discount(with correct discount calculations) and easy access to keep shoppong or go to checkout.
    
  **Checkout:**
    The checkout is expected by users to feature clear easy to fill in forms and a secure payment method, with all correct price calculations and shipping information.
    On successful secure purchase, the user is given all information of purchase and a reciept email.
